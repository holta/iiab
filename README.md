# Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB).  IIAB is a small and inexpensive device which provides essential Internet resources (Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, Khan Academy and others) *usable even when offline!*

Create the digital library needed by your school, your medical clinic, your region and/or your very own family — accessible with any nearby smartphone, tablet or laptop.

Internet-in-a-Box provides you the tools to DIY (download and customize) a local content hotspot or server, with the very best of the World’s Free Knowledge.

Schools can also choose among [30 powerful educational apps](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_services_.28IIAB_apps.29_are_suggested_during_installation.3F) for teachers and students, optionally with a complete LMS (learning management system).

FYI this community product is enabled by professional volunteers working side-by-side with schools, clinics and libraries around the world.  *Thank you for being a part of our grassroots technology movement!*
