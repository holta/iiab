*Sharing the World's Free Knowledge*

# Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB)

[Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB)](http://internet-in-a-box.org) is a "learning hotspot" that brings the Internet's crown jewels
(Wikipedia in any language, thousands of Khan Academy videos, zoomable OpenStreetMap, electronic books, WordPress journaling, Toys from Trash electronics projects, ETC) to those without Internet.

You can build your own tiny, affordable server (offline digital library) as needed by your school, your medical clinic, your prison, your region and/or your very own family — accessible with any nearby smartphone, tablet or laptop.

Internet-in-a-Box gives you the tools to:
1. DIY (download and customize) this "local learning hotspot" or server, using the [very best of the World’s Free Knowledge](http://internet-in-a-box.org/#quality-content).
2. Exchange local/indigenous knowledge with nearby communities, using our [Manage Content](https://github.com/iiab/iiab-admin-console/blob/master/roles/console/files/help/InstContent.rst#manage-content) interface and possible mesh networking.

Schools can also choose among [30 powerful educational apps](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_services_.28IIAB_apps.29_are_suggested_during_installation.3F) for teachers and students, optionally with a complete LMS (learning management system).

FYI this community product is enabled by professional volunteers working [side-by-side](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_are_the_best_places_for_community_support.3F) with schools, clinics and libraries around the world.  *Thank you for being a part of our http://OFF.NETWORK grassroots technology movement!*

## Installation

Install Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) from [download.iiab.io](http://download.iiab.io/)

Please see [FAQ.IIAB.IO](http://FAQ.IIAB.IO) which has 40+ questions and answers to help you along the way, as you put together the <!--digital--> "learning hotspot" most suitable for your own teaching/learning community.

Our [HOW-TO videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cBGCxr_WPBPa3IqPVEe3g) can be very helpful and the [Installation](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation) wiki page has more intricate details e.g. if you're trying to install Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) onto a [different Linux](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms) that has not yet been tried.

After you've installed the software, you should [add content](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#add-content), which can of course take time when downloading multi-gigabyte Content Packs!

Finally, you can [customize your Internet-in-a-Box home page](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#How_do_I_customize_my_Internet-in-a-Box_home_page.3F) (typically http://box or http://box.lan) using our **drag-and-drop** Admin Console (http://box.lan/admin) &mdash; to arrange Content Packs and IIAB Apps (services) for your local community's needs.
