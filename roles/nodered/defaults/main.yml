# TO GENERATE A NEW PASSWORD HASH, run 'node-red-admin hash-pw' and enter
# the new password.  Paste the resulting hash as above, but into your own:
#   /opt/iiab/iiab/vars/nodered/defaults/main.yml
#
# After IIAB's installer runs (or "cd /opt/iiab/iiab" then "./runrole nodered")
# username and password hash are stored in:
#   /home/nodered/.node-red/settings.js
#
# Or...on Raspberry Pi they're stored in:
#   /home/pi/.node-red/settings.js

# See http://nodered.org/docs/security.html for more detail.
