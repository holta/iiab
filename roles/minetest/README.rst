Minetest README
===============

`Minetest <https://www.minetest.net/>`_ is an open source clone of `Minecraft <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft>`_, the creative/explorational building blocks game.

The Minetest multiplayer server can be installed as part of Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) on Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu 18.04 and possibly also Debian.

Please note that the initial configuration is for creative mode, and a number of mods are installed (see the list in `tasks/main.yml <tasks/main.yml>`_).

Connecting to the Server
------------------------

To connect to the server, you will also need to download Minetest client software for each of your client devices, e.g. from: https://www.minetest.net/downloads/

The port is nominally the standard 30000.  This can be changed in `/etc/iiab/local_vars.yml <http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_is_local_vars.yml_and_how_do_I_customize_it.3F>`_ using variable: ``minetest_port``

The admin user is the usual: ``Admin``

No password is required.

Configurable Parameters
-----------------------

- ``minetest_install:`` set minetest up to install; default is False
- ``minetest_enabled:`` set minetest up to be enabled; default is False
- ``minetest_port:`` port on which client should connect; default is 30000
- ``minetest_server_admin:`` user with all permissions on minetest server; default is Admin
