# 2020-01-23: nodejs_install is completely ignored as Node.js is installed on
# demand as a dependency -- by Node-RED, Sugarizer and/or Internet Archive --
# but for now we set fake value 'nodejs_install: True' for
# 'nodejs_installed is defined' tests e.g. in 0-init/tasks/validate_vars.yml

# nodejs_install: True
# nodejs_enabled: False

# Node.js version used by roles/nodejs/tasks/main.yml for 3 roles:
# nodered (Node-RED), pbx (Asterix, FreePBX) & sugarizer (Sugarizer)

# nodejs_version: 14.x    # was 8.x til 2019-02-02, 10.x til 2019-12-21, 12.x til 2020-10-29

# All above are set in: github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/vars/default_vars.yml
# If nec, change them by editing /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml prior to installing!
